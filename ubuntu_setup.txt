install debian vm from windows app store

sudo apt update
sudo apt install libseqan2-dev
sudo apt install build-essential

to build:
copy makefile to working directory and change the target inside the makefile;
point debian to windows directory where the file (e.g. first_example.cpp) is: cd /mnt/c/CPP_Genetics/seqan_tutorial/
type in 'make' to create the executable (e.g. first_example)

run the new executable from debian (e.g. ./first_example)

'make clean' removes all the stuff we don't need from the building process
